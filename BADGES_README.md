# Badge System for Vehicle Photos

## Overview
The badge system allows administrators to add visual indicators to vehicle photos in the stock page. Badges appear strategically positioned on vehicle images to highlight special features or status.

## Features

### Available Badges
- **üî• Hot right now** - Urgent badge for high-demand vehicles
- **‚≠ê In demand** - Warning badge for popular vehicles
- **üîí Reserved** - Info badge for reserved vehicles
- **üÜï New arrival** - Success badge for newly added vehicles
- **üí∞ Special offer** - Warning badge for vehicles with special pricing

### Badge Positioning
- Badges are positioned in the top-left corner of vehicle photos
- They have a subtle shadow for better visibility
- Multiple badges can be displayed simultaneously
- Badges are strategically placed to not obstruct the vehicle image

### OpenLane Integration
- The OpenLane redirect button has been moved from the photo to the bottom action area
- It now appears as a blue button next to "Detalii" and the phone icon
- This provides better UX and more space for photo badges

## Implementation

### Database Changes
- Added `badges` field to the `stock` table (JSONB type)
- Badges are stored as an array of objects with structure:
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "text": "string", 
  "type": "success|warning|info|urgent",
  "icon": "string (optional)"
}
```

### Admin Interface
- Badge management is available in the vehicle form (Add/Edit Vehicle)
- Located in the "Detalii" tab under "Badge-uri vehicul"
- Checkboxes allow easy selection of multiple badges
- Badges are saved with the vehicle data

### Frontend Display
- Badges are rendered on the stock page vehicle cards
- They appear overlaid on the vehicle photos
- Responsive design ensures badges work on all screen sizes
- Badges use the existing Badge component with appropriate styling
